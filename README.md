# disease_propagation

## Team
Aeson Feehan, Romain Ilbert, Emmanuel Merone

## Languages
The entire project is contained in the jupyter notebook and the explanations of the code are in French.

## Description
Construction of dynamic environments for simulating the propagation of infectious diseases, in Python.

## Extensions and add-ons
To the main algorithms (for the design of virtual diseases, propagation and population environments), we added multiple extensions, including
- series of simulations,
- descriptive statistics,
- applications for public policies.
For ideas to extend the project or accelerate the simulations, see the attached report and powerpoint presentation.
